## Project Overview  
Weak and reused passwords remain one of the biggest vulnerabilities in cybersecurity.  
This project investigates why users continue to rely on insecure passwords, how attackers exploit them, and what countermeasures can reduce risk.  
It includes a client‚Äìserver simulation in a virtual environment to show how easily weak passwords can be cracked through brute-force and dictionary attacks.

---

## Objectives  
- Understand behavioral and technical causes of weak password use.  
- Analyze real data from password breaches and security reports.  
- Demonstrate password attacks in a controlled simulation.  
- Evaluate mitigation strategies like password managers, strong password policies, and MFA.

---

## Data Sources  
- Have I Been Pwned ‚Äì Password Statistics  
- Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report (DBIR)  
- RockYou password dataset (sample)  
- Research papers and case studies on password reuse and credential stuffing  

---

## Tools & Environment  
- **Operating System:** Windows 11 and/or Linux (VirtualBox / VM setup)  
- **Simulation Tools:** Hydra, John the Ripper, or Hashcat  
- **Password Managers:** Bitwarden / KeePass  
- **MFA Demonstration:** Google Authenticator simulation  

---

## Expected Outcomes  
- Better understanding of why weak passwords persist  
- Demonstration of password attacks and mitigation effectiveness  
- Practical evaluation of security tools and policies  
- Clear recommendations for users and organizations  

---

## Timeline Summary  
- **Weeks 1‚Äì2:** Gather and analyze password data  
- **Weeks 3‚Äì4:** Simulate password attacks  
- **Weeks 5‚Äì6:** Evaluate countermeasures and draft findings  
- **Weeks 7‚Äì8:** Final report, upload to GitHub, record presentation
