`sudo adduser weakuser`
Password used: **Ann123** (intentionally weak)

User fields:
- Name: Shekeeb
- Room Number: 123
- Work Phone: 444444444

### **10_Nmap_Scan.png**
**Attack & Password Cracking — Tool Setup & Nmap Scan**

Install tools on Kali:
- `sudo apt update`
- `sudo apt install nmap hydra medusa john wordlists -y`

Scan Ubuntu Server:
`nmap -sV 192.168.1.174`

Expected:
- Port 22 open
- SSH detected
- Service: OpenSSH

---

### **11_Hydra_Attack_Weak_User.png**
**Password Attack Using Hydra (Weak User)**
Command:
`hydra -l weakuser -p Ann123 ssh://192.168.1.174`

Expected output:
- ✔ Login found
- ✔ Password cracked instantly
- Time to crack: **< 1 second**

---

### **12_Create_Strong_User.png**
**Hydra Test on Strong User**
Command:
`sudo adduser stronger`
Password: **MyS3cureP@ss2025**

Fields:
- Name: Ghiasi
- Room Number: 123
- Work Phone: 44444

**Your Explanation (kept exactly):**
For the strong account (stronger with password MyS3cureP@ss2025), I tested Hydra using a single known candidate password.
Hydra reported a successful login because I supplied the correct password directly with the -p option.
In a realistic attack, a brute-force or dictionary attack would be extremely unlikely to guess this long, complex password,
especially if account lockout and rate limiting were enabled. This demonstrates that strong,
unique passwords are resistant to automated guessing, and Hydra only succeeded here because the exact password was already known.

For the weak user (weakuser), Hydra would be able to crack the password even without knowing it ahead of time,
because weak passwords are short and appear in common wordlists.
For the strong user (stronger), Hydra only succeeded because I manually supplied the exact password using the -p option.
In a real attack scenario, this strong password (MyS3cureP@ss2025!) would not be cracked by brute-force or dictionary attacks,
demonstrating the importance of strong password policies.

### **13_Offline_Attack_John.png**
**Offline Attack with John the Ripper**
Show that weak hashes are easy to crack if an attacker steals them.
Install John:
`sudo apt install john -y`

---

### **14_Export_Hashes.png**
**Export password hashes**
Run:
`sudo unshadow /etc/passwd /etc/shadow | sudo tee /tmp/passwords.txt`

---

### **15_Copy_Hashes_SCP.png**
**Copy hashes to Kali using SCP**
On Kali:
- `mkdir -p ~/hashes`
- `cd ~/hashes`
- `scp serveradmin@192.168.1.174:/tmp/passwords.txt .`

(Change serveradmin & IP if needed.)
It will ask for your Ubuntu password.

---

### **16_John_Crack.png**
**Crack the hashes with John on Kali**
Start cracking:
- `john passwords.txt`
Show cracked passwords:
- `john --show passwords.txt`

---

### **17_John_Results.png**
**John Results**
- Weakuser: NOT cracked
- Stronguser: NOT cracked

**Your Explanation (kept exactly):**
Although the user weakuser was assigned the password “Ann123”, this password is not truly weak in a cybersecurity context.
It mixes a name with small numbers and capital letter, making it less likely to appear in common dictionary wordlists.
In cybersecurity labs, a weak password typically refers to something extremely simple and commonly used, such as:
- 12345
- password / password1
- admin / admin123

### **18_Bitwarden.png**
### **19_Create_Vault_Entry.png**
### **20_Username_Stronguser.png**
### **21_Password_Generator.png**
**Password Manager (Bitwarden or KeePassXC)**
Example with Bitwarden:
1. Install Bitwarden on host Windows or inside VM.
2. Create a vault entry:
- Username: stronguser
- Password: generated 20+ character random password (with symbols)

This demonstrates how password managers make it practical to use very strong, unique passwords that are resistant to brute-force and wordlist attacks.
