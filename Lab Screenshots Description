For the strong account (stronger with password MyS3cureP@ss2025), I tested Hydra using a single known candidate password. 
Hydra reported a successful login because I supplied the correct password directly with the -p option.
In a realistic attack, a brute-force or dictionary attack would be extremely unlikely to guess this long, complex password, 
especially if account lockout and rate limiting were enabled. This demonstrates that strong, 
unique passwords are resistant to automated guessing, and Hydra only succeeded here because the exact password was already known.

For the weak user (weakuser), Hydra would be able to crack the password even without knowing it ahead of time, 
because weak passwords are short and appear in common wordlists.
For the strong user (stronger), Hydra only succeeded because I manually supplied the exact password using the -p option. 
In a real attack scenario, this strong password (MyS3cureP@ss2025!) would not be cracked by brute-force or dictionary attacks, 
demonstrating the importance of strong password policies.

                                          Although the user weakuser was assigned the password “Ann123”, this password is not truly weak in a cybersecurity context. It mixes a name with small numbers and capital letter, making it less likely to appear in common dictionary wordlists.
                                          In cybersecurity labs, a weak password typically refers to something extremely simple and commonly used, such as:
                                              •	12345
                                              •	password / password1
