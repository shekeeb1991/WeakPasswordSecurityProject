🔐 12 — Hydra Test on Strong User

Command:

hydra -l stronger -p MyS3cureP@ss2025 ssh://192.168.1.174


Your Full Explanation (kept EXACTLY as you wrote):

Hydra succeeded because you supplied the correct password manually using -p.
In a real brute-force attack this password would not be cracked due to complexity, length, and unpredictability.
This demonstrates the importance of strong, unique passwords.

Weak passwords (like Ann123) can be cracked because they appear in common wordlists.
Strong passwords cannot be cracked unless the attacker already knows them.

🧪 13 — Offline Attack with John

Install John:

sudo apt install john -y

📤 14 — Export Hashes

Run:

sudo unshadow /etc/passwd /etc/shadow | sudo tee /tmp/passwords.txt
